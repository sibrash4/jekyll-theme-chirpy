The research paper explored the influence of emerging generative tools, especially GitHub Copilot, and assessed their efficiency relative to coding performed by humans. I find this an enthralling area of study. The rapid advancements in the generative landscape have raised concerns about these tools potentially replacing humans in coding, development, and even supportive roles. This study delved into evaluating the truth of such apprehensions.

From the research, my overarching conclusion is that the results are multifaceted. The authors aptly highlight that:

  > ### ”Copilot can pose risks when relied upon by novice developers, as they might not discern its suboptimal or flawed suggestions due to their limited expertise."  

The study presents scenarios where Copilot demonstrated remarkable prowess and others where it was less effective. One limitation is the model's attention capacity. For instance, Chat GPT-4 is restricted to 8000 tokens, which may not encompass the complexity of larger projects. Although there is ongoing research to enhance the attention window of Large Language Models (LLMs), there are associated cost challenges. A noteworthy observation is that some companies have started training these models on their own datasets, indicating a promising direction for application.

A compelling use case is the application of these tools in bridging knowledge gaps. An example that stands out is the WatsonX Code Assistant for Z. COBOL, despite being a legacy language, is foundational for many governmental systems. The decreasing number of COBOL-proficient developers is concerning. Innovations like the WatsonX Code Assistant aim to bridge this deficit, marking a significant leap forward.

While innovative generative tools have made significant strides in coding and development, do they offer holistic solutions? My perspective is that they don't. The research consistently indicates that even as these systems facilitate solution implementation, the outcomes aren't exhaustive. The indispensable role of a human coder remains critical to guaranteeing the security and efficiency of the solutions.

I recently ventured into deploying a Jekyll site for Bokeh plots. Though deployment was straightforward, I sought to amalgamate two distinct themes. This entailed sifting through extensive code to merge theme elements seamlessly. Enter Copilot in Visual Studio: it significantly streamlined this task. By highlighting sections, I could prompt Copilot for explanations, which enhanced my understanding of the code. During an initial trial, I tasked Copilot with merging the config files of two Jekyll sites while eliminating redundancies. The result was less than perfect—it omitted numerous styling elements and references. However, by framing my questions judiciously and applying an intuitive approach to the code, the process became more enlightening. Rather than turning to documentation or online searches, Copilot allowed me to craft a Python script for a seminar project effortlessly. However, while its insights were valuable, it lacked the contextual understanding to build it comprehensively, but served as a useful resource for me to understand it step by step

Reflecting on our last classroom discussions: "No one writes new code; we only reuse it and improve it." Copilot epitomizes this philosophy. Yet, the divergence arises in supervising these tools. As emphasized by the study's authors, the tool's utility is magnified when it's viewed as a supplement rather than a replacement. If we excessively depend on its capabilities, we risk stagnating our learning and engagement. While Copilot can generate code, urging it to review and evaluate my work deepens my comprehension. Its current state doesn't encapsulate the reasoning and logic inherent to human cognition. Consequently, our role transforms from mere coders to full stack guides, steering our companion AI toward pertinent and precise results. The potential benefits are manifold. Merging its capabilities with traditional research methods expedites problem-solving. In my experience, feeding it intricate error messages often yields concise explanations and occasionally, rectification steps.

Utilizing generative tools in the right manner offers unparalleled advantages. It accelerates the learning trajectory, empowering individuals to venture into unexplored territories and pose challenging questions. Nevertheless, overdependence can erode our innate abilities to innovate and reason. The essence of human value resides in our capacity to ideate and manifest. Delegating this innate creativity dilutes our significance. However, this shouldn't deter us from embracing powerful tools that amplify our potential and foster simultaneous learning.

A sobering realization is our replaceability. Advanced models will invariably surge in precision as increased expertise is channeled into training and iterative enhancement. Consider Stack Overflow's endeavor to distill its expansive knowledge base into a singular chatbot. Similarly, the longstanding finance forum that I frequent, Wall Street Oasis, has unleashed an AI bot proficient in contextual replies by harnessing the cumulative insights of its 50-year-old forum posts and replies. This metamorphosis underscores the tremendous utility of tools like Copilot for adept professionals. These tools also serve as catalysts for accelerated learning and sustained relevance. The inexorable progression of time sees the quantum of tasks swelling, mirroring the phenomenon where work tends to expand to fill the available time. This dynamic landscape favors the inquisitive, urging them to fathom the underlying "whys." Those indifferent to this evolution risk obsolescence. In my perspective, this scenario epitomizes the age-old principle of survival, albeit reframed in a modern context: survival of the most adaptable and inquisitive.

These reflections pivot to a critical inference: while AI might not supplant humans, the onus is on us to perpetually refine and expand our horizons. The crux should center around relentless knowledge acquisition, skill enhancement, and evolution. If stagnation ensues, the overarching objective becomes nebulous. Furthermore, an ethical dimension emerges. A predominant apprehension among developers is the perception of AI-generated code as derivative or plagiarized. Yet, discerning the distinction between AI output and a developer gleaning code fragments from online repositories becomes blurry. Both entities essentially mimic a similar pattern. Many developers, myself included, initiate their coding journey by dissecting existing code, occasionally via unauthorized avenues. This hands-on exploration has enriched my understanding. A custom feature I've integrated prompts ChatGPT to generate five follow-up questions post every output(included below for this essay). These questions not only encourage deeper contemplation but also stimulate the exploration of new perspectives and tangents. Tools, regardless of their sophistication, derive their effectiveness from the adeptness of the user. Deploying them without understanding their functionality or the related domain dilutes their utility and over-reliance dilutes human ingenuity
